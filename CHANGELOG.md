## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD
#### Added
#### Changed
#### Deprecated
#### Removed
#### Fixed
#### Security


## [2.0.0] - 2016-10-27
#### Changed
- Dropped dependency on React (thanks to [@eliot-akira](https://github.com/eliot-akira)).



## [1.3.0] - 2016-05-10
#### Changed
- Updated to React `15.0.2`



## [1.2.0] - 2016-04-11
#### Added
- `schemaToObject(s: Function) -> Object`
  Takes something like an introspectable PropTypes.shape() and yields a
  plain object that describes the structure of that schema so that
  consumers don't have to fiddle with the introspection internals.

#### Changed
- Updated to `react@0.14.6`.
- Updated to Babel 6.



## [1.1.0]
#### Added
- Added introspection support for `arrayOf`
- Added "analyzers" that give us something close to an AST of the
propType nodes (this is opt-in for those who need it just like the
formatters)
- Added more test coverage

#### Changed
- Library can now handle introspecting & formatting of custom
PropTypes

- Simplified the validator code (got rid of the class, a single function
for validating is easier to reason about for users like myself)

#### Removed
- Implicit definition of custom `toString()` was dropped in favor of
explicit formatting; one can now choose to use the formatter directly
if they need to stringify a prop (and implement their own formatters
if we do not support them out of the box)



## [1.0.5] - 2015-11-7
#### Changed
Removed dependency on Ramda.
